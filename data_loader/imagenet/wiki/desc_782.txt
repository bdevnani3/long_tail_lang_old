A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people). When the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an electronic display.
Common applications for electronic visual displays are television sets or computer monitors.


== Types of electronic displays ==


=== In use ===
These are the technologies used to create the various screens in use today.

Electroluminescent (ELD) display
Liquid crystal display (LCD)
Light-emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD
Thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD
Light-emitting diode (LED) display
OLED display
AMOLED display
Plasma (PDP) display
Quantum dot (QLED) displayCathode ray tubes were also formerly widely used.


==== Segment displays ====

Some displays can show only digits or alphanumeric characters. They are called segment displays, because they are composed of several segments that switch on and off to give appearance of desired glyph. The segments are usually single LEDs or liquid crystals. They are mostly used in digital watches and pocket calculators. There are several types:

Seven-segment display (most common, digits only)
Fourteen-segment display
Sixteen-segment displayHD44780 LCD controller is a widely accepted protocol for LCDs.


===== Underlying technologies of segment displays =====
Incandescent filaments
Vacuum fluorescent display
Cold cathode gas discharge
Light-emitting diode (LED)
Liquid crystal display (LCD)


==== Full-area 2-dimensional displays ====
2-dimensional displays that cover a full area (usually a rectangle) are also called video displays, since it is the main modality of presenting video.


===== Applications of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Full-area 2-dimensional displays are used in, for example:

Television set
Computer monitors
Head-mounted displays, Heads-up displays and Virtual reality headsets
Broadcast reference monitor
Medical monitors
Mobile displays (for mobile devices)
Smartphone displays (for smartphones)
Video walls


===== Underlying technologies of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Underlying technologies for full-area 2-dimensional displays include:

Cathode ray tube display (CRT)
Light-emitting diode display (LED)
Electroluminescent display (ELD)
Electronic paper, E Ink
Plasma display panel (PDP)
Liquid crystal display (LCD)
High-Performance Addressing display (HPA)
Thin-film transistor display (TFT)
Organic light-emitting diode display (OLED)
Digital Light Processing display (DLP)
Surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED) (experimental)
Field emission display (FED) (experimental)
Laser TV (forthcoming)
Carbon nanotubes (experimental)
Quantum dot display (QLED)
Interferometric modulator display (IMOD)
Digital microshutter display (DMS)
microLED (in development)The multiplexed display technique is used to drive most display devices.


==== Three-dimensional displays ====
Swept-volume display
Varifocal mirror display
Emissive volume display
Laser display
Holographic display
Light field displays


=== Mechanical types ===
Ticker tape (historical)
Split-flap display (or simply flap display)
Flip-disc display (or flip-dot display)
Rollsign
Tactile electronic displays are usually intended for the blind. They use electro-mechanical parts to dynamically update a tactile image (usually of text) so that the image may be felt by the fingers.
Optacon, using metal rods instead of light in order to convey images to blind people by tactile sensation.
