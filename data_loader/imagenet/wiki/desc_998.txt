An ear is the grain-bearing tip part of the  stem of a cereal plant, such as wheat or maize.  It can also refer to "a prominent lobe in some leaves."The ear is a spike, consisting of a central stem on which tightly packed rows of flowers grow.  These develop into fruits containing the edible seeds. In corn (maize), it is protected by leaves called husks.In some species (including wheat), unripe ears contribute significantly to photosynthesis, in addition to the  leaves lower down the plant.
A parasite known as Anguina tritici (Ear Cockle) specifically affects the ears on wheat and rye by destroying the tissues and stems during growth. The parasite has been eradicated in most countries (with the exception of North Africa and West Asia) by using the 
crop rotation system.
