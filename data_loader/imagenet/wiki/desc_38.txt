Coleonyx is a genus of terrestrial geckos commonly referred to as banded geckos. Species of Coleonyx are found in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. Banded Geckos enjoy dry, warm weather which is why they are typically found in the Peninsular Desert. They are relatively small lizards, measuring about 5–6 in (13–15 cm) inches in total length (including tail). They are nocturnal and are found primarily in dry, rocky habitats. Banded Geckos have preyed by snakes, their main predators being rattlesnakes and glossy snakes. Banded Geckos can decipher how they should react when they obtain a chemical cue based on their knowledge of the predator. A main resource they use to distract the predator is losing their tail or escaping quickly. Banded Geckos possess herteromorphic euchromatic sex chromosomes which play a large role in their historical contingency.
