Knee pads or kneepads are protective gear worn on knees to protect them against impact injury from falling to the ground or hitting an obstacle, or to provide padding for extended kneeling.


== In sports ==

Knee pads are worn in many recreational and sporting activities such as cycling, rollerskating, skateboarding, cricket, volleyball, handball, basketball, gridiron football, polo, dancing, etc.  In polo, knee pads serve primarily to protect the rider's knee when "riding off" an opponent.


== In trades and military use ==
Knee pads are also used in various trades such as for the home handyman, for the police SWAT teams, and they are also incorporated into military uniforms such as the Army Combat Uniform and the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform. These knee pads are generally designed differently than the general all round high impact knee pads made for sports.


== In work ==
For example; Floor work, plumbing, tilling, mechanic, climber, bending with a constant pressure applied on knees. If work requires less or occasional kneeling, then a lighter, soft and flexible knee pad will perform better.
The knee pad should be strong enough to become the last longer companion. Another thing to take into consideration is comfort.


== For babies ==
The padding of the baby knee pads should be soft because the baby knee is the soft part of the body. The padding foam should be soft and ultra-durable. Knee pads should be in proper fitting according to baby knees.
